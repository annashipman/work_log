# What do I want to know?

How many hours a week I work

How much time I spend on different tasks, depending on how categorised; so I
need first to be able to categorise them.

Occasionally, how much time I've spent on a particular task (e.g. a particular
blog post).

# What have I got?

A CSV with three kinds of row: day, activity with time, blank.

Two types of column: time, activity. Latter is a free text field so needs
categorising. These two columsn only appear in activity rows, not in day rows.

Also some weird stuff while I was on holiday; need to work out what I want to do
with that.

Times are not consistent.
